;;; Commentary:

;; The Selectrum integration for Consult ensures that previews work when using
;; Selectrum. Furthermore, some minor Selectrum-specific `completing-read'
;; tweaks are applied. This is an extra package, since the consult.el package
;; only depends on Emacs core components.

;;; Code:

(require 'consult)
(require 'selectrum)

(defun consult-selectrum--preview-update ()
  "Preview function used for Selectrum."
  (when-let* ((fun (car consult--preview-stack))
              (cand (selectrum-get-current-candidate)))
    (funcall fun cand)))

(defun consult-selectrum--preview-setup ()
  "Setup preview support for selectrum."
  (advice-remove 'selectrum--minibuffer-post-command-hook #'consult-selectrum--preview-update)
  (when consult-preview-mode
    (advice-add 'selectrum--minibuffer-post-command-hook :after #'consult-selectrum--preview-update)))

(add-hook 'consult-preview-mode-hook #'consult-selectrum--preview-setup)
(consult-selectrum--preview-setup) ;; call immediately to ensure load-order independence

;; HACK: Hopefully selectrum adds something like this to the official API.

(defsubst consult-selectrum--configure (options)
  "Add OPTIONS to the next `selectrum-read' call."
  (when (and options (eq completing-read-function #'selectrum-completing-read))
    (letrec ((advice (lambda (orig prompt candidates &rest args)
                       (advice-remove #'selectrum-read advice)
                       (apply orig prompt candidates (append options args)))))
      (advice-add #'selectrum-read :around advice))))

;; HACK: We are explicitly injecting the default input, since default inputs are deprecated
;; in the completing-read API. Selectrum's completing-read consequently does not support
;; them. Maybe Selectrum should add support for initial inputs, even if this is deprecated
;; since the argument does not seem to go away any time soon. There are a few special cases
;; where one wants to use an initial input, even though it should not be overused and the use
;; of initial inputs is discouraged by the Emacs documentation.
(cl-defun consult-selectrum--read-advice (_prompt _candidates &rest rest &key default-top initial &allow-other-keys)
  "Advice for `consult--read' performing Selectrum-specific configuration.

_PROMPT, _CANDIDATES and REST are ignored.
DEFAULT-TOP and INITIAL keyword arguments are used to configure Selectrum."
